# BoardGames
A project to build virtual board games in java, starting with chess.This is a side project I work on in my downtime. I chose it because it's fairly straightforward to implement the concrete rules of chess. Features are slowly added overtime.

## Current Features
Every piece is fully programmed with the proper set of moves, and detection for voluntary check.
## Needed Gameplay features
*(in order of importance)*
* force a side to move out of check
* Add detection for checkmate
* Add detection for stalemate
* Add casteling
* Add queening
* Add en passant

## Future interface features
*once gameplay features are done - not in particular order*
* Timer
* Current side moving indicator
* Captured pieces indicator and score
* Toggle flipping the board based on turn

## In the future...
* Checkers
